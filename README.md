### **BikeShare Data Project**
This project is the code for the Bikeshare Data analysis project as part of the Udacity Learning Python.

The bikeshare_2.py script is an interactive terminal program that will prompt for responses then 
investigate one of three data files to answer the following questions:

1. What is the most popular month for start time?
2. What is the most popular day of week for start time?
3. What is the most popular hour of day for start time?
4. What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
5. What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
6. What is the most popular trip?
7. What are the counts of each user type?
8. What are the counts of gender?
9. What are the earliest, most recent, and most popular birth years?

### Files used
Data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

* Start Time (e.g. 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g. 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds, e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g. Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g. Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
  
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two additional columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year

The post-wrangled data files can be downloaded separately from [bikeshare-2.zip](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XdN2xlBwow2gfE_Ptp3m2pnUIx8BBDTZ)
